# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
It's useful to use a conditional when you want to differentiate between different input values that you receive for your code. It allows you to take different paths depending on the conditions you set.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
Lol I have done the assignment over again, but I'm glad that I tried all of the coding challenges at the end this time instead of just one!

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
Today I worked on the level 3 challenge and that was super rewarding since I learned a little more about the modulo function and properly ordering my syntax so that my conditions would be read properly.
